        <h2>The Height of Family Separations</h2>
        <div class="col-7">
          <h3>What is the Zero Tolerance Policy?</h3>

          <p id="text1">
            While family separations at the border were taking place long before
            the implementation of the Zero Tolerance Policy, they grew greatly
            during 2018 and the years following. This is a consequence of the
            Trump administration passing a Zero Tolerance Policy with regards to
            immigration from May 2018 to June 2018 after its original proposal
            in April 2018. As a result, migrants seeking entry at the border
            were arrested for any minor infraction at the discretion of border
            control. There were no exceptions to this policy, including for
            asylum seekers, which is a legal pathway to entering the country,
            and companions who were minors. This lead to widespread prosecution
            and family separations, particularly impacting Central American
            migrants from the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala,
            Honduras, and El Salvador. Throughout this time, there was a large
            blame game over the mistreatment of migrants trying to enter the
            country, although the separations were overwhelmingly a direct
            consequence of the policy.
          </p>

          <br /><br />

          <h3>What did family separations entail?</h3>

          <p id="text2">
            Because of the Zero Tolerance Policy, over 3000 families were
            separated. Once reaching the border, children were sent to shelters
            run by the Department of Health and Human Services, which were
            sometimes even non profit organizations. This is despite the common
            belief that these shelters are ICE facilities. However, the
            conditions are still often inhumane, with shelters being over
            capacity and failing to meet basic health standards. Children as
            young as a few months old were separated from their parents. From a
            humanitarian standpoint, this is unacceptable, especially for a
            first world country with greater resources than these migrants'
            countries of origin have. The profit coming in from these shelters
            from family separations just shows how deportation is a billion
            dollar industry.
          </p>

          <br /><br />

          <h3>When this all becomes public knowledge...</h3>
          <p id="text3">
            In 2018, the American Immigration Council filed a request for
            information on child separations through the Freedom of Information
            Act. As a result, they were able to obtain data sourced from ICE
            including demographics, facility locations, duration of stay, and
            reasons for separation for shelters all across the country.
          </p>

          <p>
            By analyzing this data, our group hopes to identify the lasting
            impacts of the policy even though it was only officially in place
            for a few months. Additionally, we want to bring more awareness to
            the issue of family separations at the border.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <h3>Interpreting the data</h3>
          <p id="text3">
            There are some key statistics that we chose to focus on within the dataset by displaying
            in our dashboard for each facility.
            <br /><br />
            1. Average duration of separation: This is the sum of all of the number of days that
            each child was separated divided by the total number of children held in that facility.
            <br /><br />
            2. Reunification rate: The dataset included information on whether each child was reunited with
            their parent. This statistic is the ratio of the total number of children per facility who were 
            reunited with their family to the total number of children held in the facility. 
            <br /><br />
            <!-- do we want to include which specific facilities were unabled to be plotted? -->
          </p>
          <p id="text3">
            Some limitations were present. Not every datapoint from the original dataset were able to be
            plotted because they could not be georeferenced. 
            <!-- do we want to include which specific facilities were unabled to be plotted? -->
