            While family separations at the border were taking place long before
            the implementation of the Zero Tolerance Policy, they grew greatly
            during 2018 and the years following. This is a consequence of the
            Trump administration passing a Zero Tolerance Policy with regards to
            immigration from May 2018 to June 2018 after its original proposal
            in April 2018. As a result, migrants seeking entry at the border
            were arrested for any minor infraction at the discretion of border
            control. There were no exceptions to this policy, including for
            asylum seekers, which is a legal pathway to entering the country,
            and companions who were minors. This lead to widespread prosecution
            and family separations, particularly impacting Central American
            migrants from the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala,
            Honduras, and El Salvador. Throughout this time, there was a large
            blame game over the mistreatment of migrants trying to enter the
            country, although the separations were overwhelmingly a direct
            consequence of the policy.

          <p id="text3" class="scrolly-text">
            In 2018, the American Immigration Council filed a request for
            information on child separations through the Freedom of Information
            Act. As a result, they were able to obtain data sourced from ICE
            including demographics, facility locations, duration of stay, and
            reasons for separation for shelters all across the country.
          </p>

          <p id="text3" class="scrolly-text">
            By analyzing this data, our group hopes to identify the lasting
            impacts of the policy even though it was only officially in place
            for a few months. Additionally, we want to bring more awareness to
            the issue of family separations at the border.
          </p>

          <h3 id="heading-3" class="scrolly-text">Interpreting the data</h3>
          <p id="text3" class="scrolly-text">
            There are some key statistics that we chose to focus on within the
            dataset by displaying in our dashboard for each facility.
            <br /><br />
            1. Average duration of separation: This is the sum of all of the
            number of days that each child was separated divided by the total
            number of children held in that facility.
            <br /><br />
            2. Reunification rate: The dataset included information on whether
            each child was reunited with their parent. This statistic is the
            ratio of the total number of children per facility who were reunited
            with their family to the total number of children held in the
            facility.

        From the data, Cayuga Centers became the home for the most amount of
        separated children during the ZTP. Across all children that were
        reunited with their families, the average amount of time spent at the
        facility was <b>77</b> days, or around
        <b>two and a half months.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        These facilities are responsible for the lives of all these children
        without their families. Therefore it is important to ask what how they
        are spending their money and doing their best to provide these children
        with the best possible living experience.
