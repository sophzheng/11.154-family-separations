            during 2018 and the years following. This is a consequence of the
            Trump administration passing a Zero Tolerance Policy with regards to
            immigration from May 2018 to June 2018 after its original proposal
            in April 2018. As a result, migrants seeking entry at the border
            were arrested for any minor infraction at the discretion of border
            control. There were no exceptions to this policy, including for
            asylum seekers, which is a legal pathway to entering the country,
            and companions who were minors. This lead to widespread prosecution
            and family separations, particularly impacting Central American
            migrants from the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala,
            Honduras, and El Salvador. Throughout this time, there was a large
            blame game over the mistreatment of migrants trying to enter the
            country, although the separations were overwhelmingly a direct
            consequence of the policy.

            When this all becomes public knowledge...
          </h3>

          <p id="text3" class="scrolly-text">
            In 2018, the American Immigration Council filed a request for
            information on child separations through the Freedom of Information
            Act. As a result, they were able to obtain data sourced from ICE
            including demographics, facility locations, duration of stay, and
            reasons for separation for shelters all across the country.
          </p>

          <p id="text3" class="scrolly-text">
            By analyzing this data, our group hopes to identify the lasting
            impacts of the policy even though it was only officially in place
            for a few months. Additionally, we want to bring more awareness to
            the issue of family separations at the border.
          </p>

          <h3 id="heading-3" class="scrolly-text">Interpreting the data</h3>
          <p id="text3" class="scrolly-text">
            There are some key statistics that we chose to focus on within the
            dataset by displaying in our dashboard for each facility.
            <br /><br />
            1. Average duration of separation: This is the sum of all of the
            number of days that each child was separated divided by the total
            number of children held in that facility.
            <br /><br />
            2. Reunification rate: The dataset included information on whether
            each child was reunited with their parent. This statistic is the
            ratio of the total number of children per facility who were reunited
            with their family to the total number of children held in the
            facility.

        <h3 id ="heading-3" class="scrolly-text"> Limitations and Nuances</h3>
            
          <p>In this piece, we attempt to compare and contrast statistics of different facilities in an effort judge the quality of each. We quickly realized that making these conclusions was difficult and, in some cases, problematic. Some facilities are genuine non-profit organizations providing children with a place to stay when politics interfered in the lives of real families. Some are not. Making these distinctions can be difficult as most all facilities with online presences present themselves with bright colors and feel-good quotes. For other facilities, there is no information to be found. Not even location data. We were forced to exclude these obscure facilities from the map visualization below. By the same token, the dataset contains little information on the conditions faced by children while within these facilities. Even more discouraging is the lack of bookkeeping on the status of the discharged minors. The dataset gives information on if a particular child was reunited with parents, or if they are still admitted to the facility. A third, more worrying option is “discharged under other appropriate circumstances.” The vague nature of this response and the fact that this option is recorded for 20-30 percent of cases on average is striking and something that can cast doubt on the facility’s record-keeping abilities. Regardless, what we want to show here through the visualizations is that children separated due to the zero-tolerance policy ended up at facilities across the country of which we have limited information. We believe there should be more public information available about different facilities so as to allow for greater accountability. We encourage users to explore the visualization, compare the statistics to those of other facilities or to the averages and do further research on particular facilities.</p>

      <p>
        From the data, Cayuga Centers became the home for the most amount of
        separated children during the ZTP. Across all children that were
        reunited with their families, the average amount of time spent at the
        facility was <b>77</b> days, or around
        <b>two and a half months.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        These facilities are responsible for the lives of all these children
        without their families. Therefore it is important to ask what how they
        are spending their money and doing their best to provide these children
        with the best possible living experience.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div id="scrollmap-content-4" class="scrollytelling-with-sidebar">
      <p>
        From the dataset we also determined that <b>9%</b> of children in this
        facility were not reported as reunited with their families. Because of
        the limitations in the dataset, their status to this day is unknown. The
        large majority, 91% of children were fortunately reunited with their
        parents, or reunited under different circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        While it is not necessarily the facility's responsibility to reunite
        children with their families, this data shows how important it is to
        keep children under the best conditions. Regardless of the
        circumstances, facilities with a low reunification rate may need to
        improve their conditions for those children staying there for an
        indeterminate amount of time.

        Each child has an individual story, and stayed at the facility for a
        varying period of time. In this arc diagram, an arc represents a child
        that was separated but then reunited.
      </p>
      <p>
        To further show the magnitude of the zero tolerance policy, we
        color-coded each arc depending on when the child was separated, whether
        it be before the ZTP was implemented, during its lifetime, or
        afterwards. In the legend we see that <b>72%</b> of children that stayed
        at Cayuga Centers during the study period were apprehended <i>during</i>
        the Zero Tolerance Policy.

        Overall, a total of <b>28,766</b> days of these children's lives were
        spent in Cayuga Centers, separated from the families. This does not even
        include those children that were never reunited with their families by
        the end of the study.
